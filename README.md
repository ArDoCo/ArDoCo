The goal of this project is to connect architecture documentation and models while identifying missing or deviating elements. An element can be any representable item of the model, like a component or a relation.

This project is based on the master thesis [Linking Software Architecture Documentation and Models](https://doi.org/10.5445/IR/1000126194).

For more information about the setup or the architecture have a look on the [wiki](https://github.com/ArDoCo/Core/wiki/Overview).
